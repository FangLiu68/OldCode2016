DFS - depth first search

BFS1 - breadth first search
    according to level
    shortest path? with graph satisfying equal weight for all edges.

what kind of problem they are solving? similar things and different things
    starting from one of the nodes in graph
    traversing the graph following a special order, or more accurately speaking, following a special heuristic
    they can both traverse all vertices in the graph
    they can both find a path from a start vertex to a goal vertex
    related to "state"(vertex) and "transition procedure"(path) - backtracking

Implementation of DFS:
    using recursion
    using explicit stack

Classical DFS
    For a graph, traverse the nodes using depth first heuristic, and each node is only visited once.
