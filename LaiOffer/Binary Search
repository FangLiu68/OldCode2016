Binary Search:
search in a sorted sequence (array, arraylist, vector) for a target. O(logN)

key point for binary search:
partition the sequence to two halves by "mid"
determine the answer should be guaranteed to be in / not in one of the halves.
there has to be a comparison operation about "mid" element
    compare to target
    compare to left most
    compare to right most
    compare to neighbor

1. we can guarantee mid is or is not the answer
