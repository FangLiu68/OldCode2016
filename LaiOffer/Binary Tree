what is the usually way of thinking -- divide and conquer
- root
- root->left
- root->right
- order? in/post/pre order


[return type] recur(TreeNode* root, [other arguments...]){

}
other arguments: pass down necessary information related to the DFS status
return type: what need to be returned to the parent

key point: clearly observe and define what should be the return value
extra processing at root node
do not forget handling the correct base case
