/*
 Given a matrix of following between N linkedin users (with ids from 0 to n-1):
 followingMatrix[i][j] == true iff user i is following user j
 thus followingMatrix[i][j] doesn't imply followingMatrix[j][i]
 lets also agree that followingMatrix[i][i] == false
 
 Influencer is a user who is:
 followed by everyone else and not following anyone himself
 
 This method should find an influencer by a given matrix of following, or return -1 if there is no influencer in teh group
